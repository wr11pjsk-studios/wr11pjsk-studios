## My name is Phil, I'm 17 years old. My house is in the east section of the french city of Metz, where all the residence skyscrapers are at. I'm not married.I work as a senior class student in high school, and I get home every day by 6PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink non-alcoholic beer. I'm in bed by 1 AM, and make sure I get five hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and coding my latest work of art, kanade&friends, a discord bot used for anything I can think of, I do not have any trouble sleeping.
